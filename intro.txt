Hey there!

I am Sehar Panesar. I am currently a BS/MS student at Purdue University studying Computer Science, and
I love building things with software. 

As of June 2022, I am looking for a SWE intern position for 2023 Summer. Most of my experience is with
backend software engineering, but I am also interested front end engineering. 
I am also available for freelance work! 

I have hosted some of my projects on this website, so feel free to browse around and contact me. 

Thanks,
Sehar Panesar
